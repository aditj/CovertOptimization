### Code for benchmarking multi armed bandits with SPSA algorithm and backward induction 

#### Directory Structure
- ```benchmark_bandits.py``` : Main file to run the benchmarking experiment.
- ```backwardinduction.py```: File containing the backward induction algorithm

#### Instructions to run the code
1. Run the ```benchmark_spsa_bandits.py``` file to start the benchmarking experiment. The parameters are described in the file.
2. The results will be printed on the terminal.
3. Run the ```backwardinduction.py``` file to run the backward induction algorithm. The parameters are described in the file.
4. The results will be printed on the terminal.
